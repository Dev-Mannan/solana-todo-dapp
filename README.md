# Solana To-DO Dapp

The Solana Blockchain To-Do List is a decentralized task management application deployed on the Solana Devnet, enabling users to create, complete, and delete tasks directly on the blockchain using markdown formatting. What sets this project apart is that users receive their Solana fee back in their wallet when they delete a task after completion, adding an exciting incentive to efficiently manage and organize tasks on the blockchain.
